# quadrupedRobotDog
This is the code of a project created to the university of Coimbra (portugal).
The ideia was create a patrol dog, using livestream using wireless to monitor your home. 
It could not be completed, becouse we have many problems in stability, so it is not able to walk properly
We added some proximity sensors connected to 3 color led
